#summary Findings about enabling the Boot animation

Logcat spits this:

}}}

frameworks/base/cmds/bootanimation/BootAnimation.cpp does that

first it looks for "images/android-logo-mask.png" and "images/android-logo-shine.png" -- not sure where these should be.  If it can't find them, it looks for /data/local/bootanimation.zip or /system/media/bootanimation.zip

Then, inside the zip file, it tries to parse desc.txt which is meant to be in this format:

{{{
width height fps
p count pause path
p count pause path
...
}}}

frist line (doesn't have to be first -- it could be anywhere, and it can be repeated but the last line only will be used) defines the animation, then after that 'p' lines add parts of it.

I'm not exactly sure what are <count> and <pause> values for, but the <path> is a filename of the image to be loaded.  there's a comment that says 'supports only stored png files' so I'd assume thats it -- no jpgs or anything else.
