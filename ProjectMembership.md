# Introduction #

This project is open-source and everyone is welcome to join and contribute.


# Details #

Google Code caters for 3 types of project members -- owners, committers, contributors, and everyone else that's not recorded.

## Everyone else ##

Anyone with gmail account can post comments to wiki pages, and raise issues.  Please try to raise issues with this project, not the issues that are related to the hardware nor other projects -- we can't change that.

## Contributor ##

Anyone that helps in any way, shape, or form, is a contributor.  Those that want to be listed as such, please post a coment below, and we'll be able to add you to the list.

Contributions are -- comments on work done, reports on things that work or dont work, demands for new functionality, code, apps, suggestions, work, anything you produce in any form that is visible to the rest of the community is a contribution, regardless of invidivual observer's opinion on value of the contribution.

Sometimes the most negative comments about an idea can contribute positively to create a new line of thought that adds value to the project.  Everyhting is welcome.  e-garbage is not welcome (spam, unrelated posts, adverts, flaming)

Contributor appears to have the same abilities as eveyrone else not in the project, with exception that their name is mentioned on the main page.

## Committer ##

If you want ability to change any of the wiki pages, create downloads, modify the source code, please ask for it.

## Owner ##

Current project owners are listed on the right side of the front page.  Owners have the ability to change members ranks, change the front page, and everything else the same as committers.

Intention is to keep the most active committers as 'owners', keep this list dynamic and with a purpose.  There are no legacies, active committers are the owners, those that are not as active will be moved back to committers.

Criteria for this is not defined at this stage.  At the least, you should have compiled android and contributed to the project -- either by sharing your code (if applicable) or comments, or experiences, or suggestions.
