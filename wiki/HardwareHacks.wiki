Progress on findings about the N19 hardware, and possible hacks done to it


= Details =

This is the landing page for the N19 hardware hacks. This is work in progress. Following any of the directions on this page will most likely *cause permanent damage to your phone* if you don't have the correct skills nor the correct tools. We, the custom-android-sciphone-n19 community shouldn't be made liable in case you lose money, data or hardware following any of these instructions.

== Findings ==

The main CPU is a Samsung `S3C2442` processor, clocked at 400mhz. Datasheets and other stuff about the CPU may be found at the [http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/mobilesocProductDown.do?userId=pq.wang@besovideo.com#component_SC32442 Samsung's page].

Reading from the init.rc script, there're capabilities for a GPS module on serial port 1 (serial port 0 is for the GSM module). The GPS module is referenced as a neo1973, and the `OpenMoko` Neo 1973 is using a UART GPS module named _Hammerhead PMB 2520_ AGPS from _Global Locate_, the people at `OpenMoko` have a driver for it at https://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/src/target/kernel/patches/gta01-power_control.patch implemented as a plugin for the GPSD daemon. Although there are no such device as _neo1973-pm-gps.0_ in _/sys/bus/platform/devices/_ folder.

All this data has been gathered without actually opening the phone, later on, when i open up the phone i will post some photos and tell you all the details.

The LCD Driver is [http://custom-android-sciphone-n19.googlecode.com/files/ILI9331.pdf Ilitek ILI9331].

Power management chip: Dialog Semiconductor DA9030.
