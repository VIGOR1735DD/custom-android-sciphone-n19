= Introduction =

These are the guidelines that should be followed when adding the version number/name for the [http://custom-android-sciphone-n19.googlecode.com/files/android-n19.png build logo].


= Details =

  * *Version name* (e.g. Cupcake, Donut, Eclair, etc.) should be put on the blank part above the androids.
  * *Build number build state and android version number* (v0.2 unstable - 1.5) should be put like the pattern between the parentheses below the androids row.
  * *Sizes of the fonts*: For the version name, it should be something between 18-20 px; for the build number, build state and android version number should be 10px.

All fonts should be white 0xFFFFFF arial narrow bold.



It would be nice if we included the Version logo (the ones google uses, like an eclair, a donut, etc.) at the right side of the version name.
