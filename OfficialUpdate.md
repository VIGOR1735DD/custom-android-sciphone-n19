# Introduction #

This is the update content that leaked out of mysciphone.com  It is yet to be formally confirmed to be the update.


# Details #

Depending on the version of your Sciphone N19, this update will work, or not.  If it doesn't work it will leave your phone as it was, without any changes.

The update brings Market application to N19, so it is possible to download Android Market apps.

Download it at http://custom-android-sciphone-n19.googlecode.com/files/Image_N19_EN_20100106_900_1800_Update_Market.rar

Un-rar the contents of the file, follow instructions inside the file.

It seems that N19's what are dated september 2009 (in 'about phone') get stuck during the update and cannot complete.  Phones dated 1st of Dec 2009 complete the update.

Also make sure you use standard SD card.  HD or HC versions cause boot loader to ignore the card, and never do anything with the update.

## Update for September 2009 builds ##

It has been identified that update doesn't work on these phones due to the size of the image.  Reduced image is now available at: http://custom-android-sciphone-n19.googlecode.com/files/modded-sciphone-n19-official-update-01.zip

Follow the same process -- unzip, copy to SD card, insert into phone, reboot phone.

Update will now complete.

After the update you may want to adb push the files that were taken out.  These are available at http://custom-android-sciphone-n19.googlecode.com/files/missing-files-from-moded-update.zip
