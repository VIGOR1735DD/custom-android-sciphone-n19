This is the landing page for the N19 hardware hacks. This is work in progress. Following any of the directions on this page will most likely *cause permanent damage to your phone* if you don't have the correct skills nor the correct tools. We, the custom-android-sciphone-n19 community shouldn't be made liable in case you lose money, data or hardware following any of these instructions.

== Findings ==

The main cpu is a Samsung S3C2410 processor, clocked at 400mhz. You can find the datasheet of the CPU on the downloads section.

Reading from the init.rc script, there're capabilities for a GPS module on serial port 1 (serial port 0 is for the GSM module). The GPS module is referenced as a neo1973, and the OpenMoko Neo 1973 is using a UART GPS module named _Hammerhead PMB 2520_ AGPS from _Global Locate_, the people at OpenMoko have a driver for it at https://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/src/target/kernel/patches/gta01-power_control.patch implemented as a plugin for the GPSD daemon.

All this data has been gathered without actually opening the phone, later on, when i open up the phone i will post some photos and tell you all the details.
