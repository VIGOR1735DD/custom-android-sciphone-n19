#summary Landing page for findings about enabling touchscreen support on custom builds.

Found this on the Logcat:

`I/EventHub(  434): New device: path=/dev/input/event0 name=S3C TouchScreen id=0x10001 (of 0x2) index=2 fd=51 classes=0x4`

Looks like the device is /dev/input/event0 now we got to find out what kernel module manages it.
