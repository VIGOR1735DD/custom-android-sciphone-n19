#summary HowTo Repack root filesystem (ramdisk)

= Introduction =

Guide on repacking the root filesystem


= Details =

To do this, you will need Linux operating system with uboot-mkimage package available for Ubuntu and Debian distributions.  I'm not sure how to get it for other, but you could always download uboot source from http://www.denx.de/wiki/DULG/UBootVersions and compile it.

== Unpacking ==

1. Copy ramdisk.uimg from the official update

2. Remove first 64 bytes:
{{{
dd if=ramdisk.uimg bs=64 skip=1 of=ramdisk.gz
}}}

3. Unzip it
{{{
gunzip -v ramdisk.gz
}}}

4. create empty directory and chdir into it
{{{
mkdir ramdisk
cd ramdisk
}}}

5. unpack ramdisk
{{{
cpio -i < ramdisk
}}}

6. Do whatever you intended to do with it.

== Packing ==

1. chdir into directory that has ramdisk files (everything in there will be packed up, make sure you don't have anything you didn't intend)

2. Pack and zip
{{{
find . -print | cpio -o -H newc | gzip > ../ramdisk.gz
}}}

3. chdir one level up

4. Make the image (this is where you need uboot-mkimage)
{{{
mkimage -A ARM -O Linux -T ramdisk -C gzip -a 0x00 -e 0x00 -n initramfs -d ramdisk.gz ramdisk.uimg
}}}

5. copy this file together with other update files, flash your phone, see what happens.
